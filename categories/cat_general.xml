I started this blog to document some of the things that I'm hacking, hence the wonderfully creative name. I've been meaning to do this for about 5 years now, but choosing the right blogging platform is a daunting task... and a really good excuse to put off the work of getting things set up and actually started. Anyway, now here I am. I hope the projects I document here are interesting to others, and help me remember how the heck I did these things!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a little about me, for work I do security consulting. Network and physical penetration testing, social engineering, wireless pen, application testing and other similar stuff. Some of that will likely spill into this blog, in fact I just stumbled across a fun Wordpress plugin vulnerability that I'll write about in the next post. After work, I like to keep hacking on things. Right now I'm working on some fun 6502/SID chip projects, firmware updates for the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/linklayer/BLEKey"&gt;BLEKey&lt;/a&gt;, and cleaning the cobwebs off of all the other dev boards on my desk, floor and in the couch cushions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/b14rk"&gt;Youtube channel&lt;/a&gt; with some of my past projects/tinkering, until I actually get a real post up there is some (old) content there to check out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://blog.basegg.io/posts/im-hacking-some-of-the-things/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2016 02:05:07 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
