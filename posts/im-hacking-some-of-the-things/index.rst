Hey everyone. I started this blog to document some of the things that I'm hacking, hence the wonderfully creative name. I've been meaning to do this for about 5 years now, but choosing the right blogging platform is a daunting task... and a really good excuse to put off the work of getting things set up and actually started. Anyway, now here I am. I hope the projects I document here are interesting to others, and help me remember how the heck I did these things!

Just a little about me, for work I do security consulting. Network and physical penetration testing, social engineering, wireless pen, application testing and other similar stuff. Some of that will likely spill into this blog, in fact I just stumbled across a fun Wordpress plugin vulnerability that I'll write about in the next post. After work, I like to keep hacking on things. Right now I'm working on some fun 6502/SID chip projects, firmware updates for the `BLEKey <https://github.com/linklayer/BLEKey>`_, and cleaning the cobwebs off of all the other dev boards on my desk, floor and in the couch cushions. 

I have a `Youtube channel <https://www.youtube.com/user/b14rk>`_ with some of my past projects/tinkering, until I actually get a real post up there is some (old) content there to check out!
